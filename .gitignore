# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)

# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

#     FROM ANSWER: Apple says "don't ignore it"
#     FROM COMMENTS: Apple is wrong; Apple code is too buggy to trust; there are no known negative side-effects to ignoring Apple's unofficial advice and instead doing the thing that actively fixes bugs in Xcode
# Up to you, but ... current advice: ignore it.
